Veracode Community Open Source Projects
=======================================

A collection of useful open source projects that integrate with the CA Veracode APIs to automate scanning, results retrieval and other tasks. These are community contributed and not supported by CA Veracode.

Developer tools
---------------

* [Ansible](https://github.com/telusdigital/ansible-veracode-scanner) - allows uploading and scanning with Veracode from Ansible, with an option to send results to a Slack channel

* [Bamboo](https://gitlab.com/buzzcode/Bamboo-Veracode) - full featured Bamboo plugin including configuration UI, wait for scan to complete, and "break the build" functionality

* [Bamboo/Jira](https://github.com/buildcom/VeracodeAtlassianPlugin) - provides a pair of simple plugins for upload and results handling from within Bamboo, and a lightweight script to create Jira issues

* [ConcourseCI, Gitlab, Travis](https://github.com/ctcampbell/veracode-ci-examples) - Example configurations for integrating Veracode scanning in various continuous integration systems.

* [Gradle](https://github.com/kctang/vt) - Set of Gradle tasks, usable either as a command line submission tool or integrated as part of a continuous integration build process, to perform Veracode submission for applications and scan results for flaws.

* [Slack](https://github.com/ctcampbell/veracode-slack-slash-command) - AWS Lambda commands that provide the ability to access Veracode application and build information from Slack.
